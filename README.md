# Assistive-Robot
This project combines the capabilities of an obstacle-avoidance robot with the intelligence of Scooby, a Python-based AI assistant. This fusion creates a versatile robot that not only navigates through obstacles but also offers an array of interactive features.

Key Features:

1. Obstacle Avoidance: The robot is equipped with sensors that enable it to detect obstacles in its path. Using intelligent algorithms, it swiftly maneuvers to avoid collisions, ensuring safe navigation in dynamic environments.

2. Path Redirection: Upon encountering an obstacle, the robot dynamically recalculates its path to find the most efficient and obstruction-free route. This adaptive feature guarantees optimal progress towards its destination.

3. Voice-Controlled AI Assistance: Leveraging Scooby, our AI assistant, the robot responds to voice commands. Users can converse with the robot, instruct it to perform tasks, ask about the weather, access news updates, play music, and engage in natural language interactions.

4. Interactive Conversations: The robot is not limited to obstacle avoidance alone. Users can have engaging, two-way conversations with Scooby. From addressing queries to providing recommendations, the assistant adds a personalized touch to the robot's interactions.

5. Enhanced User Convenience: Scooby's capabilities offer a seamless user experience. Through voice commands, users effortlessly interact with the robot, providing a hands-free and intuitive control mechanism.

6. Real-world Applications: This project holds immense potential in various domains. It can serve as an assistive device for the visually impaired, autonomously navigating in environments. Additionally, it can be deployed in scenarios requiring remote assistance or information dissemination.
